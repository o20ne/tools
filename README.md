My Personal Tools
==========
This is my personal collections of tools I've used throughout my coding years.
The purpose is to document, clean up & share since it's getting huge.


### [License]
There is no license for the codes, it's either taken from multiple sources, edited or created from nothing.
Due to this nature, I don't think a license is appropriate, please let me know if you know of a appropriate license for sharing this.

I've tried to put the source of the codes as much as possible if I remember.
If any author realised that the codes inside is theirs and wish to remove or do anything to it, please let me know.
